Screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.  In a recent animal study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. Tasked to generate tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study, as well as a top-level summary of the study results.
